GitHub Questions:

1) What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
2) What does fast-forward in git mean?
3) Why should you have different branches?
4) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?


Answers:

1) The gitignore file is a text file that tells git to ignore these any
changes made in these files. For a Java project, the gitignore file should
include Compiled class files (.class), Log files (.log), Package files
(.jar, .war, .nar, .ear, .zip, .tar.gz, .rar), and other addtional files
like BlueJ files (.ctxt), J2ME files (.mtj.tmp/) and VM crash logs.

2) Fast-forward is a way to merge two branches by advancing the source branch
pointer to target branch pointer when there is a direct linear path between the
source and target branch. It avoids the need of an extra merge request as all
changes would have carried over to the target branch in a linear fashion.

3) Having branches allows you to work separately on features of the code
without having to worry about changes made on the main branch. It is also used
develop and test your code without worrying about breaking the main project
code. It allows multiple people to develop a project and work on different
features simultaneously in a collaborative environment, and provides seamless
integration of features when good SCM practices are followed.

4) Usually when you clone a project's Git repository, you usually maintain one
remote repository, named 'origin' by default, from where your local repository
fetches any changes made.
